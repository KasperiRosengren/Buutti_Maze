Maze

Pentti got stuck in a maze.

Implement an algorithm to find a route through a maze given in a .txt file, or
tell if there is no possible route available.

In the map file a ‘#’ represents a block, ‘ ‘ (whitespace) represents movable space
and ‘E’ means an exit. ‘^’ is the starting position. Going outside the maze
area is not allowed.

Pentti can move in 4 directions, and each move has an equal cost. Each map
should be tried with the same algorithm with 20, 150 and 200 maximum
moves.

The solution with the correct route must be printed to something visible, either to a file, on
the command line, or graphically. The optimal solution is not required, but bonus points for
providing it! The program should accept an input file given by the user.
